# ADR-0001– Name and Scope
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Context
We need a clear product name and the initial scope boundaries to keep the project minimal and focused.

## Decision
Name the tool "TypeSketch": a concise type‑oriented YAML derived from JSON samples.
Scope focuses on exploration and documentation; not a full validator. JSON Schema/OpenAPI emitters may be added later.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Communicates the intent succinctly.
- Keeps the first release minimal and useful.

**Negative / Trade-offs:**
- Some users may expect validation; that is explicitly out‑of‑scope initially.
