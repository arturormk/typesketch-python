# ADR-0000â€“ Record Architecture Decisions

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-10-19

## Context

We need a way to record the architectural decisions made on this project. This includes decisions about technology choices, design patterns, and development practices.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document architectural decisions in this project.

ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` using the format:
- Filename: `NNNN-kebab-title.md` (4-digit incremental index)
- Required sections: Context, Decision, Consequences
- Status keywords: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Decisions are documented and easily discoverable
- New team members can understand the reasoning behind choices
- We can track the evolution of architectural decisions
- Forces us to think through decisions more carefully

**Negative / Trade-offs:**
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Additional documentation overhead

**Follow-ups:**
- Create ADR index file
- Add ADR linting to CI/pre-commit
- Reference ADR IDs in code comments where relevant
